# Moneybird Examples

Just some quick examples of using the Moneybird API in PHP. [Moneybird][mb] is the best online invoicing tool for freelancers and small companies. It's a shame they only operate in The Netherlands.

You'll need their [PHP API class][mb_php_class] to actually use these examples.

For more information, check the excellent [online API documentation][mb_docs] or create an issue in this repository.
